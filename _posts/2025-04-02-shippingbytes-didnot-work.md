June 2024 I started a new website called ShippingBytes. I thought I was looking
for a place where I could write tech articles about lesson learned and similar
that felt wrong to write here.

This blog to be is more like a diary, writing about what I am doing and why
more than how. I wrote many how-to articles here but I also skipped many
because I didn't want to publish them here.

Anyway, I tried to figure out a writing schedule, daily, weekly but it quickly
turned to never.

My plan was to use ShippingBytes to do a bit of branding for a future where I
will find myself doing consulting and freelancing work. I am not sure if it
will ever happen or if I will like such career but I tend to change companies
more often than what I would like to and this makes me to think that probably
being an employee is not what I should do for my entire career.

But something I learned along the way is that there are many many companies
doing very cool things and that I want to learn from and work with. And many
people told me that doing consulting and freelancing has its own complexity and
its own skillset like everything. I also feel like my skillset is very wide and
not that deep. I did a lot of experience with Kubernetes, I joined the Release
Team for a few iterations but I don't want to work with it for 8 hours. For
this reason if you want to pay the most up to date, and most skilled Kubernetes
expert I am not that person, I can figure everything out but I don't know
everything and I feel the same for everything I know. A few people are really
into eBPF, they like the topic, they expanded as security expert and I think it
is the good intersection of skills and market that can turn into a sustainable
consulting experience. I can't relate to any technology I work with or
techonlogy I want to invest into.

Yep, there is a bit of missfeeling as you can notice and if you feel the same
let me know with an email [ciao@gianarb.it](mailto:ciao@gianarb.it) because I
want to know how you feel about it as well.

This article may feel a bit negative but I learned a few things and I started
to experiement with alternative models that may work for me, but they are long
term and I don't have enough to share just yet. The TLDR is that I started
sharing my wide tech skills with a couple of friends that happened to run a
successfully business and that wants to expand in the digital side (who does
not want to) in exchange of piece of the stake of the company itself or some
sort of royalies. It will work? I don't know but I will let you know.

This will may force me to move out from a full time job but we will see and
diversifying is something that I think I want to apply to my dialy job as well
not only as investing strategy because it sounds like a good strategy for this
time of uncertainties where a full time job is not that stable as it should be.

Anyway to get back to the main topic I am going to keep ShippingBytes as domain
for a bit because I like the name, and I thought about a name for a long time
so I want to see how it ages for a bit more but I removed the blog and I
won't write there. I left the newsletter box because you never know but I
think I know.
