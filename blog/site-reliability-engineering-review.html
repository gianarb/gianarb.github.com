    <p>I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/2pfeHBU">Site Reliability Engineering</a> a lot of months
ago. I read the ebook first but I am the kind of people that buy also paper
books when they are good, so if you are working on a distributed and scalable
environment it’s something that you should read.</p>

<p>Published by O’Reilly and edited by Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff
and Niall Richard Murphy it is written by many Google engineers and it’s about
the experience they made scaling services like Google Maps, Calendar, YouTube
and all the other products.</p>

<p>I spoke with different people about this book and a lot of them told me that
there is nothing new on that. It’s just cool because Google made it cool.</p>

<p>I have a different option. It’s a nice book because it is a complete source of
information about design and processes in a highly scalable environment.
Probably
some of them topic are well known but it’s hard to find all this information in
a single place.</p>

<p><img alt="Site Reliability Engineering book" src="/img/sre-book.jpeg" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>To be fair, it has 524 pages so it’s not a fast read. It  took me few
months but I keep it around when I need to explain concepts like how to
dimension and measure loads in a services environment. SLA, SLO and how to use
them properly to manage and measure risks are
well explained, circuit breaking and more, in general, a lot of good procedures
about
resiliency, teamwork, delivery are explained in this book.</p>

<p>There is a nice chapter about how to use the metrics to set up a function and
smart alerting system to keep engineer on-call in a safe and comfortable
environment.</p>

<p>Another one about how Google design resilient applications and how they
dimension services. How much and how deep they know their services impressed me
a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Site Reliability Engineering</strong> is a good mix of concepts that you can apply
through your day to day no-at-Google job and the all the
Google scale “freaky fun”.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I will define like the bible for an engineer that wish to work
in a high-scalable environment. Doesn’t matter if you are not there yet or if
you
won’t serve millions of requests per second. It’s good to read and to keep
around.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/book/index.html">HTML version</a> of this book
is now available online for free.</p>
