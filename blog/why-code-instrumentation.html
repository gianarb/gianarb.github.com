<p style="display:none;" class="note" id="adv-sponsor">Hey! I see you use an adblocker as I do as
well! I use Carbon Adv to support this tiny website a network with developers

    <article>
    <p>I am writing this blog post as a common introduction for a new category I would
like to write about consistently on my blog. If this is the first time you land
here this is my blog, and I write about everything that catches my attention but
sometime earlier sometime later on I realize I can group my posts in categories,
and that’s what I am doing now.</p>

<p>Some of them are: <a href="/planet/assemble-kubernetes.html">Assemble Kubernetes</a>,
<a href="/planet/docker.html">Docker</a>, <a href="/planet/mockmania.html">MockMania</a>. This one
will be called <code>Code Instrumentation</code>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people writing about observability, monitoring and I did it
for the last 3 years as well. I learned a lot along the way but what I think is
crucial is that developers has to write code that is
understandable and easy to debug where it is more valuable, in production. And
if an application or a system is hard to figure out we as a developer play a
mojor role on it.</p>

<p>That’s why Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is not related to ops, servers,
Kubernetes but it is something that plays its match in your code.</p>

<p>What’s why I think SRE and DevOps are different, not at all connected.</p>

<p>The technologies that are leading the landscape are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prometheus but not the time series database, their client libraries and the
exposition format, now branded from the community and the Cloud Native
Computing Foundation (CNCF) as OpenMetrics</li>
  <li>OpenTracing, OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry. They are part of the same bullet
points because I think about them as the consequence of each other since what
I hope is “THE LAST ONE”, OpenTelemetry. They are instrumentation libraries
and specification to increase interoperability and to avoid vendor lock-in
for what concerns distributed tracing and metrics. I hope logs will jump
onboard at some point</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="prometheus-and-openmetrics">Prometheus and OpenMetrics</h2>

<p>I wrote about this topic previously, so have a look there if you do not know
what I am speaking about.</p>

<p>I think they are worth to mention here because that’s how I learned the effect
of good or bad code instrumentation, and the fact that it has to happen in your
code, when you develop it.</p>

<p>It has the same weight has writing a good data structure, writing solid unit
tests, or picking the right design pattern.</p>

<h2 id="opentelemetry-otel">OpenTelemetry (otel)</h2>

<p>As I said I will refer to otel when I can, not because I think OpenTracing or
OpenCensus is bad, but because I do not see this as a religion, but for me it is
a technical problem, they is well spread and it has to find a good answer.</p>

<p>Those communities decided to merge to otel in the way they are doing, good or
bad? We can get a beer at some point and I will tell you. It is out of scope.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-am-gonna-talk-about">What I am gonna talk about</h2>

<p>This is a long new category introduction blog post probably but that’s it. Over
the last two years I tried to share what I experienced around this topic with a
workshop called: “Application Monitoring”. A lot of the articles that I will
write comes from there, and it is an attempt to share what I think worked or
failed.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/planet/code-instrumentation.html">All about Code Instrumentation</a> from my blog</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gianarb/shopmany">ShopMany</a> is the application I developed for the workshop</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gianarb/workshop-observability">Workshop notes</a> contains notes, exercises and solutions for the lessons I
proposed in the workshop itself</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/">honeycomb</a> because when you speak about o11y you have to quote them!</li>
  <li><a href="/tinyletter.html">My newsletter</a> is probably the best way to stay in touch with the content I
create</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">Twitter</a> is the best way to stay in touch with me</li>
