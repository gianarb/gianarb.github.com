    <p>I wrote an article about a <a href="/blog/kubernetes-GitHub-action">GitHub Action</a> I
recently created to deploy my code to kubernetes. Very nice.  Writing the action
and the post, I realized what serverless is all about.  I wrote it in the
incipit of the article, but I think this topic deserves its dedicated post.
Serverless is not yet for web applications. I know some of you will probably
disagree but this is my blog, and that’s why I have one, to write whatever I
like!</p>

<p><img src="/img/brave_dad.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I used Lambda and API Gateway to distribute two pdf I wrote about <a href="https://scaledocker.com">“how to scale
Docker”</a>, it looks to me way more complicated than a go
daemon. So I wrote them because I got the free tier and because I like to try
new things.  There are excellent applications written in that way for example
<a href="https://acloud.guru/">acloud.guru</a> but I am probably not ready for that! My bad</p>

<p>Anyway, I know what I am ready for: We should use serverless to offer
extendibility for our as a service platform.</p>

<p>Good for us distributed system and hispters applications are all based on
events, Kafka and so on. Plus now we have
<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runC</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">buildkit</a> and a lot of the building blocks
useful to implement a solid serverless implementation.</p>

<p>It is not easy, at scale this is a complicated problem but we are in a better
situation now, and it is a massive improvement from a product perspective:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using containers, we can offer total isolation, and we can take a very
carefully and self defensive approach.</li>
  <li>An API already provides extendibility but, you still need to have your server
and to run your application by yourself to enjoy them. With a serverless
approach, it will be much easy for the customer to implement their workflow.</li>
  <li>You can ask your customer to share their implementation creating a vibrant
and virtuous ecosystem.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use a subset of the event that you write in Kafka as a trigger for the
function, VaultDB to store secrets that will be injected inside the service and
so on.</p>

<p>There is a lot more, but I am excited! Is somebody doing something like that? If
so, let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">@gianarb</a>, I would like to chat!</p>
