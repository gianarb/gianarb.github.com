    <p><img src="/img/mainbg_scaledocker.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>In the process of make some order in all my repositories, side projects and so
on my terminal crossed over a project I made in 2017 called scaledocker. The
idea was a full book. It turned out to be a 2 pdf one describing Docker for a
totally beginner, the second one about security.</p>

<p>Looking back I see why I am so happy to build and share what I do, I am still
like that today!</p>

<p>I was discussing with Jenny about what do with this project and we thought about
the possibility to refresh those contents as part of a series in docker.com.</p>

<p>I had a look around at this scenario, the contents are still good but I can’t
find the raw version of the PDF. It makes this work very hard. That’s why I
decided to archive it here.</p>

<p class="lead">scaledocker.com will stay up and running redirecting everybody to this article,
where you can find both PDFs. It is for sale, just <a href="mailto:ciao@gianarb.it">make an
offer</a> you can have it starting from Sept 2020.</p>

<p>This is not at end at all! There is an all section in my blog related to
<a href="/planet/docker.html">docker</a> and who knows what I will work on in 2020! I just
do not like the idea to have this project keeping a domain busy, I bet there are
people that can make a better use of it as I tried to do few years ago!</p>

<p>In order to stay in touch with me my website is a good way and I rumble a lot on
<a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">twitter</a> as well!</p>

<h2 id="docker-the-fundamental">Docker the Fundamental</h2>

<p class="small">25 pages</p>

<p><img src="/img/the-fundamental-cover.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-25 p-3 float-right" /></p>

<p>Getting Started about Docker, it covers basic concepts about what container
means and it’s a starting point to understand containers, Docker and all the
ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="docker-security---play-safe">Docker Security - Play Safe</h2>

<p class="small">55 pages</p>

<p><img src="/img/container-security.png" alt="" class="img-fluid w-25 p-3 float-right" /></p>

<p>When you think about production everything stops to be a joke. Containers, cloud
computing, scalability is something that fit well with security? I have my
personal response for this question and with this paper I am going to show what
I mean with security and how containers, docker, Linux can make this real.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Mutual TLS and Security by default</li>
  <li>Content Trust</li>
  <li>Overlay Network</li>
  <li>Docker Bench Security</li>
  <li>Process Restriction and Capabilities</li>
  <li>Open Source</li>
  <li>Linux Kernel Security</li>
  <li>Cilium</li>
  <li>About your images</li>
  <li>Secret Manager</li>
  <li>Immutability</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lets-move-on">Let’s move on!</h2>

<p>I hope this project will keep helping new folks to get onboard with Docker or to
figure out what they can do to improve security.</p>

<p>From what I can tell more than 2200 people required those PDFs! I am happy and
impressed. I can’t wait to see what we will do next!</p>
