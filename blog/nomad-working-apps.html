    <article>
    <p>It is a couple of years now since my first conference and now that I am working
in remote, it is even harder to combine traveling and work.</p>

<p>Mainly because now that I don’t need to go to an office I travel more often, and
usually conference are a better more far away too. It means that I spent more
time, not in my usual workplace.</p>

<p>It is a very challenging and exciting opportunity, and I am glad to live it.
This is the first important things I think. If you are not happy about what you
do, even if it is challenging, you are going to give up.</p>

<p>But other things help me a lot. In general, they are come back to <code>planning.</code> I
feel better when I have the time to look around and to be prepared for the city
I am going to visit. There are a couple of apps that help me with that:</p>

<h2 id="workfrom"><a href="https://workfrom.co/">WorkFrom</a></h2>
<p>It is a community of digital nomad and remote worker. It keeps up to date a
database of pubs, libraries, restaurants, bars where you can work from.  It is
very nice, and it has some nice feature like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A map, so you can see what is around you</li>
  <li>Net speed measurement inside the app. Other than a detailed description of
the place it also shares (if the person who reviewed the area made it) how
the internet connection is fast and sometimes even the WiFi password, in this
way you don’t need to ask.</li>
  <li>As I mentioned it is a community, so there is also a Slack Channel that you
can use to speak with another remote worker.</li>
</ol>

<p>I used it in Berlin, Munich, Copenaghen, Amsterdam and it worked pretty well.</p>

<h2 id="bike-and-other-local-transport-applications-i-am-using">bike and other local transport applications I am using</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.o.bike/it/">oBike</a> as an example because just because I used it
recently in Munich but I think you should always have a look to what the city
uses for bike sharing, for instance, because at least for me even if I love to
walk around take a ride time to time is faster and helpful.</p>

<p>Bonus point a lot of these apps have a free tier in means that you can even use
them for free the first time you visit that city!</p>

<h2 id="yelp">Yelp</h2>
<p>In general, I find <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> better than TripAdvisor for
what concerns restaurant and place to eat. So when I am not able to spot nothing
good by myself during my walks around the city or when I am looking for a
specific kind of good I use Yelp.</p>

<h2 id="adobe-scan">Adobe Scan</h2>
<p>For this <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html">app</a> I need to give
credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/fntlnz">Lorenzo</a> because he showed that app to me
the first time. I use it a lot after a trip when I need to submit the expenses.
It is always a very annoying work to do but at least with this app, I can take a
set of pictures, and it will generate a single pdf ready to be submitted!</p>

<h2 id="revolut">Revolut</h2>
<p>A few years ago when I was working at CurrencyFair I started to test
and play with online banks and <a href="https://revolut.com/r/gianlu1b2">Revolut</a> is
very good when you are traveling around, and you need to manage different
currencies. First of all, I like the idea to use a different card when I buy on
Amazon or when I travel because in case of any trouble I will have a limited
amount of money there. For example in Cube I had my card cloned but I only had
10 Euro, so it was not the first count. (the bank give me the money back in any
case btw).</p>

<p>Plus Revolut has some excellent features to track where and what you spent.  You
can label your transfers to easy lookup them when you need to expense or
calculate how much you spent. The exchange commission low compared with the more
traditional banks, so this is a free win!</p>

<p>Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">Twitter</a> if you have any other
applications to suggest I will be happy to try them next time and maybe to add
them here!</p>
