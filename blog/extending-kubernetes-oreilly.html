well! I use Carbon Adv to support this tiny website a network with developers

    <article>
    <p>A few months ago I wrote a report with O’Reilly called <a href="https://get.oreilly.com/ind_extending-kubernetes.html">Extending
Kubernetes</a>. I realized I
didn’t share this major achievement here with all of you!</p>

<p>It comes from my experience not from ops but as a developer that works with
Kubernetes.</p>

<p>K8S requires a big effort in terms of maintenance and setup, who says something
different lies. Complexity is not too bad and sometime it is a requirement, a
good way to justify it is to use kubernetes as much as you can.</p>

<p>Operations and teams need a good UX, Kubernetes is extremely extensible with
custom resource definitions, kubectl plugins, controller, shared informers,
audit logs and operators.</p>

<p>This report is about it. I meanly use Go for the examples but a lot of them can
be re-written using any SDK provided by the Kubernetes community.</p>

<p>It is a practical report, with code examples and ideas about what you can do to
integrate your day to day operations with Kubernetes in order to share the pain
with the developers.</p>

<p>Now that I recovered from the effort of writing it, stay tuned because I am
looking for something else to do!</p>
