    <article>
    <p>I recently joined Packet, a company acquired by Equinix, finally after 7 years
working with cloud computing I can see how they look like from the other side!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center">
  <p>Spoiler alert: clouds are made of servers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a first task I had to revamp the kubernetes cluster-api implementation,
moving it from v1alpha1 to v1alpha3. Kind of cool and in a domain I know very
well. We tagged the first release and I can’t wait to see how it will be used.
I got some meetups and webinars planned about it, so stay in touch on
<a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">twitter</a> to know more about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the topics I am curious about is hardware automation. The idea to
get up and running, in a repeatable and autonomous way a piece of inanimate
metal well known as rack, switch, server is a topic I never touched and I would
like to know more! Obviously, this is only one of the articles I will write about
the topic. Mainly because there is much to learn.</p>

<p>As you can image when we buy a server it does not do much, it’s great to keep
your door open, and as a table. It has to be configured, in our case customers
can do it via API, it means there is some code involved! I want to know more!!</p>

<p>For sure there are a couple of things that you have to do manually, assemble the sever,
power it on, plug the ethernet cable in, pick the right location and things like
that.</p>

<p>But as you can imagine it comes without operating system, even more complicated to
install because the customers can select the one they like most, or even push
their own one. This is for sure something that has to be done magically, I doubt
we have people running with USB stick in a datacenter installing operating
systems.</p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.anonimacinefili.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/forrest-gump-25-anni.jpg?fit=1200%2C600" alt="Forst Gump picture" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>One of the things that happen when booting a laptop or server
is the bootloader. The one that requires a master skill to get in because there
is a timeout, and I never know what to press! I have to be honest I thought they
were pretty static and not that fun.</p>

<p>BUT, there are smart boot-loaders! We know what smart means does days: internet! In
practice there is a bootloader capable of booting not from USB, not from disk
but from the internet.</p>

<p>Usually a private network but it is not mandatory, and we spend the last couple
of years doing <code>curl something.com | bash</code>.  The bootloader downloads a
<code>kernet</code>, the <code>initrd</code> and it will <code>boot</code> an operating system. It is like having a
USB stick that starts the live installation of Ubuntu, there is a lot more after
that because we have to persist the installation on disk, format them and so on.</p>

<p>In this article I will show you at first how to get to something that looks like
like the installation wizard for ubuntu, and also how to automate the
installation via preseed.</p>

<p>The bootloader is called PXE, and the new generation I used is called iPXE.</p>

<p>The cool things about PXE/iPXE is that you can chain scripts from one to
another. <a href="https://twitter.com/grhmc">Graham Christensen</a> told me that the main
goal when you work with PXE is to escape from it and get to iPXE, that is way
cooler. Time for a recap:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The machine starts and enters PXE</li>
  <li>PXE download and chains iPXE in this way we are on iPXE bootload</li>
  <li>From iPXE you can download kernel, initrd and boot the OS in RAM.</li>
</ol>

<p>IPXE supports different ways to download what it needs from the internet, the
one I used so far are TFTP and HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-pxeipxe">What is this PXE/iPXE?</h2>

<p>Such a nice question, I had the same one few days ago. A couple of links:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">Wikipedia: Preboot Execution Environment</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ipxe.org/">iPXE: open soure boot firmware</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Roughly you can think about iPXE as a shell that has a bunch of commands like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>dhcp: to require an IP from a DHCP server and configures the network
interface</li>
  <li>route: to figure out if the network interface is configured (if it has an IP
already)</li>
  <li>chain: gets an argument (a URL) and it executes the content, it is a good way
to pass scripts</li>
  <li>You can see variables <code>set name value</code></li>
  <li>kernet: downloads the kernel from a source and load it</li>
  <li>initrd: download the init ramdisk</li>
  <li>boot: triggers the boot</li>
</ol>

<p>And <a href="https://ipxe.org/cmd">many more</a> that I did not use yet but docs lists
them.</p>

<p>It also has support for building a menu like this one:</p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="https://netboot.xyz/images/netboot.xyz.gif" alt="netboot menu" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>The image comes from <a href="https://netboot.xyz/">netboot.xyz</a> as you can see from
their website is a project that simplify the process of installing a lot of
different operating systems via PXE. I started with it at first for my
experiments. Obviously menus and automations does not play nice together but in
the process of learning I took this extra step.</p>

<h2 id="hello-world">Hello world</h2>

<p>To give you some context this is the script I used to start the installation
wizard for Ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>#!ipxe
dhcp net0

set base-url http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/
kernel ${base-url}/linux console=ttyS1,115200n8
initrd ${base-url}/initrd.gz
boot
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it looks familiar, some code at least. In order to
reach the internet you need an IP, and to get one if you are lazy like me is to
use a DHCP (the alternative is to set one statically). The first command does that, asks the DHCP an IP for the network
interface <code>net0</code>.</p>

<p>When the IP is set, iPXE reachs <code>ubuntu.com</code> to get the kernel and the initrd.
Everything I need to boot an OS in RAM.</p>

<h2 id="lets-try">let’s try</h2>

<p>I am using <a href="https://packet.com">Packet</a> for my tests because it serves the low
level capabilities I need, it supports the server creation without OS and with
iPXE. You can register and do it yourself, <code>gophernetes</code> is a coupon that will
give you 30$ credit.</p>

<p>When you request a device (a server) on Packet you can select the operating
system, we don’t need to do it, so you can select <code>Custom iPXE</code> because we are
going to install it ourselves.</p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="/img/packet-create-device.png" alt="A screenshot from packet.com about how to create an on demand device with Custom iPXE" class="img-fluid w-75" /></p>

<p>There are two ways we can inject out script to iPXE in order to teach the server
what to do when it boot, first one is giving a URL (I use a gist (raw link)), or
via user data. The script I used is the one pasted above. You can create a gist
and paste the link in “iPXE Script URL” or you can use the user data, as I am
doing right now.</p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="/img/packet-user-data.png" alt="A screenshot form packet.com about how to pass a user data to a server" class="img-fluid w-75" /></p>

<p>As soon as the machine starts you can click on its name to enter the get its
details and you get a ssh into the “Out-of-Band Console” console:</p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="/img/packet-out-of-band.png" alt="A screenshot from packet.com that shows where to locate the out-of-band
console" class="img-fluid w-75" /></p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="/img/packet-out-of-band-ssh.png" alt="A screenshot from packet.com that shows how to get the ssh command to use
the out-of-bound console" class="img-fluid w-75" /></p>

<p>ALERT: if you are doing this activity, remember to enable OpenSSH when you
follow the installation wizard otherwise you won’t be able to SSH in the server
at the end!</p>

<p>When deploying the server the code you passed gets chained from the Packet iPXE.
And you should see the Ubuntu wizard ready for you:</p>

<p class="blockquote text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center text-center"><img src="/img/packet-ubuntu-install-wizard.png" alt="A screenshot from my terminal that shows the first wizard for ubuntu" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>At the end of the wizard you will get a persisted operating system in the server
itself, it will survive the reboot and it will be just as any other server you
used in the past, but better because you know how you installed the OS! Get its
IP and ssh in!</p>

<h2 id="preseed">Preseed</h2>

<p>Debin like operating system, like Ubuntu support a technology called
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/apb.html">preseed</a>, it
practice is a text file that contains the answers for all the questions the
Ubuntu wizard makes.</p>

<p>In this way no point and click is required. I put together a file here and I
uploaded it as a gist:</p>

<pre><code>#### Contents of the preconfiguration file (for stretch)

d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note
</code></pre>

<p>It is a bit weird but if you are familiar with
the Ubuntu installation process I am sure you can spot some similarity.</p>

<p>At this point we have to pass some <code>cmdline</code> arguments to the kernel in order to
have it downloading the preseed file from a raw gist and to tell the kernel that
the installation is automatic:</p>

<pre><code>#!ipxe
dhcp net0

set base-url http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/
set preseed-url https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gianarb/acea1ca5b73a318fd74cbb002cae21f3/raw/76e5d036ee28c485cc7cf42a317c99e678f08a6c/ubuntu.preseed
kernel ${base-url}/linux console=ttyS1,115200n8 auto=true fb=false priority=critical preseed/locale=en_GB url=${preseed-url} DEBCONF_DEBUG=5
initrd ${base-url}/initrd.gz
boot
</code></pre>

<p>The mechanism is the same as before, you can create a gist and link it during
the server creation or you can paste this as cloud init.</p>

<p>At this point you can connect to the <code>Out of Band</code> console via ssh and the
installation wizard will look like a movie! When the process is over the server
reboots and you will be able to SSH in using username: <code>yay</code>, password
<code>norootnoroot</code>. If you are looking for the root password have a look at the
preseed file, the answer is there!</p>

<p>Preseed is probably not what you want at the end, but it is an easy enough way
to get to a persisted OS. It does a lot runtime, by consequence it is time
consuming and it can be flaky when reaching the network.
<a href="https://twitter.com/thebsdbox">Dan</a> pointed me to other ways to do it using
<code>raw</code> images but probably I will experiment moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it, this is a layer I am not familiar with Packet has an open
source project called <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/">Tinkerbell</a>, that does bare metal
provisioning.</p>

<p>I want to know what it does under the hood! In practice is an open source
version of the provisioner used internally to set up servers. We are moving
towards to it as well!</p>

<p>A lot of the underline technologies like preseed, PXE are 20 years old, and as I
like to say: “I have a lot of new things to learn from the 80s”.</p>

<p>Don’t know where this will bring me but I think the next articles will look
like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to get a iPXE server to serve my own kernel, initrd</li>
  <li>How to get a set of RPIs provisioned</li>
</ol>

<p>Point me to the right direction or if you are curious to know more about this
topic.</p>
