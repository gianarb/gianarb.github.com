    <p>Every developer loves to share things about it’s setup. They also loves to make
it better and to spend time on it.</p>

<p>Lorenzo <a href="https://twitter.com/fntlnz">(fntlnz)</a> is super on it! I am
not, plus I bought a Zenbook 3. Super slim, less than 1kg, I can use it to cut
ham probably but the unique USB-C is driving me crazy.</p>

<p>Probably more than the actual 40 degrees that I have in my home office now!
It is probably why I am writing this post btw.</p>

<p>When I bought this laptop 7 months ago the Universal Docker Station was not
available and I wasn’t even able to install linux on this laptop.</p>

<p>Now I have an <a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops-Accessory/Universal-Dock/">Asus Universal Dock
station</a>. I am feeling a
little bit better but to work it replace a normal charger, it means that without
a socket near you, I can not use a USB… Amazing experience.</p>

<p>I tried other adapter but I didn’t find one good enough. Every one of them had
some input or output port unusable for some reason. Most of them because the
BIOS has a different watt limit and they can not charge the laptop. I never
received a response from ASUS about it. That’s great.</p>

<p>Anyway I am writing this article just as note for myself about the driver that
Lorenzo discover to have the Asus Universal Dock Station’s ethernet port
running.</p>

driver</a>.
It’s super easy to install. Just compile it and it will work.</p>
