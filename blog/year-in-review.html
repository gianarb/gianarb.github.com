    <article>
    <p>I can’t say 2019 was great from a working point of view. I struggled a lot and I
probably had a small and dirty burnout. I learned about myself along the
way. A few folks that joined me at Influx left, I didn’t really enjoyed that
time and the massive growth the company had didn’t help me. I had some
difficulties finding my place and since there I didn’t really find the right
motivation to be productive such the passion for this job forces me to be.</p>

<p>Luckily I am surrounded by friends and colleagues with an open mind, I just had
to ask and to speak loud about my feelings, I always got back useful
conversations. I am sure every situation is different but other people
experienced similar situation and it is great to have them around. I think it is
getting better, I work in a different team now, the amount of YAML I have
to write decreases, I am back writing bugs and fixing them.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-is-about-collaboration">Open Source is about collaboration</h2>

<p>Open Source is part of my daily job and the reasons about why are well explain in
my first podcast ever! You can find it on <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-new-stack-makers/e/60409328?autoplay=true">The New
Stack</a>.</p>

<p>TLDR: I learned how to write code pinging people on IRC since day one. Different
communities helped me to improve in my daily job as nobody ever did. That’s why
open source is part of myself and I can’t stay without it. Even more now that I
have something to get back.</p>

<p>This year I stopped to do small projects in my GitHub profile all alone. It was
a natural decision that I didn’t took on purpose. Even more where I discovered
that my shitty useless code is gonna destroy the Arctic because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o">GitHub spams it
there</a>.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to discover a community called
<a href="https://github.com/testcontainers">testcontainers</a> they do cool things but you
know about them because I wrote <a href="/blog/testcontainers-go">“testcontainer library to programmatically
provision integration tests in Go with containers”</a>, I
tweet a lot about it and I spoke at DockerCon about the same topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoKlADdiLmU">“Write
Maintainable Integration Tests with
Docker”</a>.</p>

<p>Recently at Influx we was looking for a way to setup a continuous profiling
infrastructure, some work is still ongoing but Vladimir wrote a nice open source
project called <a href="https://github.com/profefe/profefe">profefe</a>, we deployed it and
I wrote a Kubernetes integration called
<a href="https://github.com/profefe/kube-profefe">kube-profefe</a>. It is now part of the
profefe organization and I am planning to write a series of posts about it, so
stay toned!</p>

<p>Join ongoing community and projects that you LIKE and USE is way better than
writing something alone that looks probably similar to something that already
exists. It is not easy, you have read more code, you have to reach out to other
people that will may be busy but I will keep doing it!</p>

<h2 id="meetups--conferences">Meetups &amp; Conferences</h2>

<p>I run the CNCF Meetup in Turin, let me know if you would like to speak! I do it
because I work from home for a company based in San Francisco. They are far away
and I spend a lot of my working our by myself. My local community helps me to
develop great connections with people close to me! Ordering pizza, finding
locations, speakers, sponsors are unused tasks that I enjoy. All the videos are
available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCke-1vle73H9Dy4ojdfLw5A">YouTube</a>
some of them are in English other are not.</p>

<p>This year the plan is to run a nomad meetup, we will move office by office in
order to meet more people and to be cool companies or startups.</p>

<p>Would you like to sponsor, speak, host us?! Reach out
<a href="mailto:ciao@gianarb.it">ciao@gianarb.it</a> (Turin only locations).</p>

<p>I made way too many talks during the first part of the year (counting 11), and the
difficulties I had at work convinced me to take a break. I didn’t took any
flight since June (almost), I feel recharged now but I will keep a low
number of events this year. I would like to write more and to do more podcast.
Do you host one? Let me know!</p>

<h2 id="write">Write</h2>

<p>I wrote 26 articles. I am impressed by the number now that I see it. My articles
come from what I built I need to keep doing fun projects in order to have
something useful to write. I will probably stay focused on Extending Kubernetes
because I like how dynamic the code is, I would like to keep experimenting with
<a href="/blog/reactive-planning-and-reconciliation-in-go">reconciliations loops and reactive
planning</a> and to study Control
Theory because <a href="/blog/control-theory-is-dope">“it is done”</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cherryservers.com/?utm_source=garb&amp;utm_medium=ftr&amp;utm_campaign=drs">CherryServers</a>
is a cloud provider that I met at ContainerDays in Hamburg and since there we
loved each other! I can ping them and have fun on their platform as much as I
like and this is great. They do not have a Kubernetes story yet, let’s see if we
can do something about it! If you need to write an operator or a CSI plugin
(persistent storage), or who knows even a Cluster API implementation let me
know!</p>

<p>My first collaboration with a publisher was good but not excellent. I wrote a
report for O’Reilly called <a href="https://get.oreilly.com/ind_extending-kubernetes.html">“Extending Kubernetes”</a>. I didn’t get any
information from there about how it is going but it is a normal practice for “a
report” for what they told me.
I defined it “not excellent” because it does not look like a collaboration, it
is a one shot effort. I am happy to see it live because I like to write, but
it is not my best skill. This collaboration helped me to raise the bar.</p>

<p>In 2019 as I did for open source I would like to collaborate with other people,
maybe to write another book. Something is moving but let me know if you
have any idea.</p>

<h2 id="2020">2020!</h2>

<p>If I have to pick a word to describe 2019 I will use <code>join</code>. I <code>joined</code> a lot of
great people/teams embracing what they care or they were working on. I loved
that. I hope to keep doing it with the help of the communities I am part of like
Docker, observability, Kubernetes, CNCF, testcontainers. I hope to join more
people that shares my passions in order to improve and build something together.</p>

<p>In order to do that I need you all around! Reach out

<h2 id="home-sweet-home">Home sweet home!</h2>

<p>We have a new project! The most important one! We bought a house and there is a
lot of work to do! Look at how this wall is going down! Made in YAML.</p>
