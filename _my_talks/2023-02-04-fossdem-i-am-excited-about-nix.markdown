title: 'I am excited about NixOS, I want to tell you why!'
description: "Yup, you heard me right! I am two years into Nix and NixOS bause I endedup
working with a team deeply involved with such technology that I never hear
about even if I spent 8years out of 10 doing cloud computing, automation and
YAML! I have to admit it is not easy to pick up, nix is weird, you never know
what options to use and now it is all about flakes but I feel powerful.

In this talk I want to show you my dotfiles and how I manage my little homelab.
I will talk to you about netbooting, nixos-rebuild build-vm. A practical and
driven by frustration approach to NixOS"
