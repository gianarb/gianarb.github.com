    I would like to build a feed manager. Something like a server that fetches
    articles from a set of feeds continously running as a daemon and serves an
    API that can be used primarly via TUI. The server should be not mandatory
    the TUI can do the same work from a snapshot in time.

    I like the idea to have this website running not as static site. Because it
    sounds like an opportunity to try thrid party services like Honeycomb or
    open source tools like prometheus.  It is a a way to experiment and to keep
    my operantional experience up to date.  Just to be clearn, not enough
    traffic or reasons currenty stops me from doing that.

    My experience with e-calendar kind of sucks. Personal gmail account,
    company gmail account. Offline events. Reconciliation and notification is
    not a joy. I know, the right solution is to avoid e-meetings but I need an
    alternative solution.
