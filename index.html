    <p>I am Gianluca and this is the corner I cut for myself from the public internet.</p>

    <p>I am a developer, consuming and contributing to free software. I am a
    former CNCF Ambassador, Docker Captain and Kubernetes Release Eng. <p>I
        jump back and forth between operations and development. I write about
        my journey here on my blog. I speak at <a
        href="/conferences">conferences</a> time to time.</p> <p>Do you
        want to stay in touch? I am on various platforms, <a href="/contacts">keep the one
