I want to describe my current challenge to you.
I need to design a booking system that sync bidirectionally with Google Calendar.

```
+--------+        +------------+        +------------+
|        +------->|            +------->|            |
|  User  |        |   Booking  |        |    GCal    |
|        |<-------+            |<-------+            |
+--------+        +------------+        +------------+
```

A user can book a slot from pool of predefined availability, the booking system
needs to sync the new event to Google Calendar so an operator can see the new event and confirm.

When the confirmation is done the reservation changes status and the user receives a notification.

The predefined availability is as well a Google Calendar that can be modified
by an operator and it needs to be kept in sync as well because it varies the
possibility for a user to make a reservation.

Let me know how you would implement it.
